Wiki trinket code
==========

Story
----------

I play a game called [Puzzle Pirates](http://www.puzzlepirates.com).  I love to collect trinkets in that game.  I keep track of all of my trinket collections in [a Google Doc spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1inW-EHRdDE36UD2YAD767BYHdcwovJE-Pbe-OMrcLGs#gid=6).  However, when people are willing to sell me trinkets, they usually want a quick, easy way to tell if what they have is what I'm missing, and they don't want to deal with spreadsheets.  The easy solution is to put [my collections](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Jamesh/Trinkets) on the [wiki for Puzzle Pirates](http://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com).  I like to keep my spreadsheets as the "official" version of what I'm collecting, since it's much easier to update on the fly.  But I don't want to have to manually update each wiki page every time I get a single new trinket.  So, I made this project.

Functionality
----------
Takes my spreadsheets (stored as .txt files) and creates wiki code.  Currently only works for single-colored trinkets with one (or more) consistent palettes. Specifically, it works for:

* Brigand King trinkets (one for [just in my name](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Jamesh/Trinkets/BK) and [one for anybody's name](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Jamesh/Trinkets/BK/All))
* [Beachcomber trinkets](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Jamesh/Trinkets/BC)
* [Atlantis trinkets](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Jamesh/Trinkets/Atl)
* [Cursed Isles trinkets](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Jamesh/Trinkets/CI)
* [Haunted Seas trinkets](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Jamesh/Trinkets/HS)
* [Kraken trinkets](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Jamesh/Trinkets/Kraken)
* [Viking raid trinkets](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Jamesh/Trinkets/VR)
* [Black box trinkets](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Jamesh/Trinkets/BB)
* [Gold box trinkets](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Jamesh/Trinkets/GB)
